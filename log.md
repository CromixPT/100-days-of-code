### Day 2: August 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made some progress on udemy Web Developer bootcamp. Researched bootstrap 4 changes and made adaptations for the current project.
                      Tried to do freeCodeCamp Product land page, but not there yet. 

**Thoughts:**: CSS turned to be harder than I expected, can't get my head arround the flex thingy to build a fixed navbar on top, BOOTSTRAP is so much easier.
